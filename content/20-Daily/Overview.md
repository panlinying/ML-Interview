# Daily Notes (How to Use)

Daily notes are the “execution layer” of the 10-week plan: they tell you exactly what to do today.

## A good daily session

1. **Warm-up (10 min):** redo 1 problem from yesterday from memory.
2. **Main set (60–90 min):** 3–6 problems using the 5-step loop in **[[00-Reference/Execution Playbook (Optimized)]]**.
3. **Log (10 min):** write:
   - Pattern name
   - Invariant (1 sentence)
   - Move rule (2 lines)
   - The pitfall you hit

## Navigation

- Start from **[[00-Reference/Calendar Map]]**
- Or jump to **[[10-Weeks/Overview]]** and pick a week
