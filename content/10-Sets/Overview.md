# Practice Sets (How to Use)

Sets are the primary unit of practice. Each set focuses on one pattern cluster and 3-6 problems.

## A good session
1. **Warm up (10 min):** redo 1 old problem from memory.
2. **Main set (60-90 min):** work through the problems using **[[Practice Loop]]**.
3. **Review (10 min):** write the pattern, invariant, and pitfall.

## Recommended cadence
- 4-5 sets per week
- Go in order to build momentum

## Start here
- **[[00-Start/Practice Home]]**
