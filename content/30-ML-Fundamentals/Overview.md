# ML Fundamentals (Overview)

Goal: build the “interview-ready” mental model of ML (math → classical ML → deep learning → transformers) and be able to explain tradeoffs clearly.

## What to aim for in interviews

- Explain bias/variance, regularization, and evaluation metrics
- Derive backprop at a high level (chain rule intuition)
- Compare architectures (CNN vs RNN vs Transformer) and training tradeoffs
