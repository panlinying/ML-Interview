Maximum Subarray (Kadane)** **Pattern:** DP compressed into 1 variable **Invariant:** cur = best subarray sum that **must end at i** **Update:** cur = max(nums[i], cur + nums[i]), best = max(best, cur) **Pitfall:** initializing wrong when all numbers are negative → start with best = cur = nums[0] **238. Product of Array Except Self** **Pattern:** prefix * suffix (two passes) **Invariant 1 (left pass):** res[i] = product(nums[0..i-1]) **Invariant 2 (right pass):** suffix = product(nums[i+1..n-1]), then res[i] *= suffix **Pitfall you hit earlier:** don’t assign res[i] when res=[] → use res=[1]*n **217. Contains Duplicate** **Pattern:** set membership **Invariant:** after processing first k numbers, seen contains **exactly** those k values **Rule:** if x in seen → duplicate found **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space **121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** **Pattern:** “min prefix” + best profit so far **Invariant:** min_price = minimum price seen so far best = maximum profit achievable up to today **Update:** best = max(best, price - min_price) then min_price = min(min_price, price) **Key insight:** you’re basically doing Kadane on price differences, but this invariant is simpler. **283. Move Zeroes** **Pattern:** slow/fast pointer (stable compaction) **Invariant:** nums[0..slow-1] are **all the non-zeros** seen so far in original order **Update:** scan with fast; when non-zero, swap/assign into slow then slow += 1 **Pitfall:** preserving order matters → use stable compaction, not random swaps. **167. Two Sum II (sorted)** **Pattern:** two pointers on sorted array **Invariant:** answer (if exists) is always inside [l, r] **Move rule:** sum too small → l++ sum too big → r-- **Why it works:** pointer moves are monotonic with sorted order. **125. Valid Palindrome** **Pattern:** two pointers + filtering **Invariant:** all characters **outside** [l, r] have already been validated as matching **Step:** skip non-alnum on both sides; compare lowercase; move inward **Pitfall:** forgetting to skip both sides correctly. **1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points** **Pattern:** geometry greedy (Chebyshev distance) **Invariant:** minimal time from point A to B equals max( dx , dy ) because you can move diagonally to reduce both each step **Total:** sum that value for every consecutive pair **Common mistake:** using dx + dy (Manhattan) instead of max. **The “template buckets” (how to recognize next time)** **Bucket A — “Scan + maintain best so far”** 53 (Kadane), 121 (min_price/best) **Trigger words:** maximum/minimum, “best subarray/profit,” continuous scan **Invariant style:** “best ending here” / “min prefix” **Bucket B — “Two pointers”** 167 (sorted), 125 (palindrome), 283 (compaction) **Trigger words:** sorted array, palindrome, remove/move elements in-place **Invariant style:** “outside is solved; inside remains” **Bucket C — “Two-pass accumulation”** 238 prefix/suffix **Trigger words:** “except self”, “for each i depends on left and right” **Invariant style:** “left product already correct” then “multiply right product” **Bucket D — “Set / uniqueness”** 217 **Trigger words:** duplicates / seen before **Invariant style:** “set equals processed items” **Bucket E — “Math shortcut”** 1266 **Trigger words:** grid moves, diagonal allowed, shortest time/steps **Invariant style:** distance formula is preserved Review (2–5 lines)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Tasks","slug":"20-Daily/2026-01-12","anchor":"tasks","category":"Daily Notes","pageTitle":"2026-01-12 (Week 1 • Day 1) — Arrays & Two Pointers"},{"kind":"section","title":"Notes / Blockers","slug":"20-Daily/2026-01-12","anchor":"notes-blockers","category":"Daily Notes","pageTitle":"2026-01-12 (Week 1 • Day 1) — Arrays & Two Pointers"},{"kind":"section","title":"**53.
