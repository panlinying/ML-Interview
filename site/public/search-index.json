Product of Array Except Self Medium Video LC 53. Maximum Subarray Medium Video Notes **53. Maximum Subarray (Kadane)** **Pattern:** DP compressed into 1 variable **Invariant:** cur = best subarray sum that **must end at i** **Update:** cur = max(nums[i], cur + nums[i]), best = max(best, cur) **Pitfall:** initializing wrong when all numbers are negative → start with best = cur = nums[0] **238. Product of Array Except Self** **Pattern:** prefix * suffix (two passes) **Invariant 1 (left pass):** res[i] = product(nums[0..i-1]) **Invariant 2 (right pass):** suffix = product(nums[i+1..n-1]), then res[i] *= suffix **Pitfall you hit earlier:** don’t assign res[i] when res=[] → use res=[1]*n **217. Contains Duplicate** **Pattern:** set membership **Invariant:** after processing first k numbers, seen contains **exactly** those k values **Rule:** if x in seen → duplicate found **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space **121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** **Pattern:** “min prefix” + best profit so far **Invariant:** min_price = minimum price seen so far best = maximum profit achievable up to today **Update:** best = max(best, price - min_price) then min_price = min(min_price, price) **Key insight:** you’re basically doing Kadane on price differences, but this invariant is simpler. **283. Move Zeroes** **Pattern:** slow/fast pointer (stable compaction) **Invariant:** nums[0..slow-1] are **all the non-zeros** seen so far in original order **Update:** scan with fast; when non-zero, swap/assign into slow then slow += 1 **Pitfall:** preserving order matters → use stable compaction, not random swaps. **167. Two Sum II (sorted)** **Pattern:** two pointers on sorted array **Invariant:** answer (if exists) is always inside [l, r] **Move rule:** sum too small → l++ sum too big → r-- **Why it works:** pointer moves are monotonic with sorted order. **125. Valid Palindrome** **Pattern:** two pointers + filtering **Invariant:** all characters **outside** [l, r] have already been validated as matching **Step:** skip non-alnum on both sides; compare lowercase; move inward **Pitfall:** forgetting to skip both sides correctly. **1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points** **Pattern:** geometry greedy (Chebyshev distance) **Invariant:** minimal time from point A to B equals max( dx , dy ) because you can move diagonally to reduce both each step **Total:** sum that value for every consecutive pair **Common mistake:** using dx + dy (Manhattan) instead of max. **The “template buckets” (how to recognize next time)** **Bucket A — “Scan + maintain best so far”** 53 (Kadane), 121 (min_price/best) **Trigger words:** maximum/minimum, “best subarray/profit,” continuous scan **Invariant style:** “best ending here” / “min prefix” **Bucket B — “Two pointers”** 167 (sorted), 125 (palindrome), 283 (compaction) **Trigger words:** sorted array, palindrome, remove/move elements in-place **Invariant style:** “outside is solved; inside remains” **Bucket C — “Two-pass accumulation”** 238 prefix/suffix **Trigger words:** “except self”, “for each i depends on left and right” **Invariant style:** “left product already correct” then “multiply right product” **Bucket D — “Set / uniqueness”** 217 **Trigger words:** duplicates / seen before **Invariant style:** “set equals processed items” **Bucket E — “Math shortcut”** 1266 **Trigger words:** grid moves, diagonal allowed, shortest time/steps **Invariant style:** distance formula is preserved Review (2–5 lines)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Problems","slug":"10-Sets/Set 01 - Arrays & Two Pointers","anchor":"problems","category":"Practice Sets","pageTitle":"Set 01 - Arrays & Two Pointers"},{"kind":"section","title":"Notes","slug":"10-Sets/Set 01 - Arrays & Two Pointers","anchor":"notes","category":"Practice Sets","pageTitle":"Set 01 - Arrays & Two Pointers"},{"kind":"section","title":"**53.

Related: Plan: [[20-ML-Core/Module 01 - Math Foundations + Classical ML]] Concepts tracker: [[20-ML-Core/Concepts TrackerClassical ML]] Quick reference: [[20-ML-Core/ML Cheat Sheet]] 2.1 Linear Models Linear Regression **What to Know:** **Interview Questions:** Q: When would closed-form solution fail? A: When XᵀX is singular (not invertible), which happens with: Multicollinearity (correlated features) More features than samples (n < d) Solution: Use regularization or gradient descent Q: What's the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? A: Logistic Regression **What to Know:** **Interview Questions:** Q: Why use cross-entropy instead of MSE for classification? A: MSE with sigmoid creates non-convex loss (multiple local minima) Cross-entropy is convex for logistic regression Cross-entropy gradient is stronger when prediction is wrong Cross-entropy relates to maximum likelihood estimation Q: How do you handle multi-class classification? A: --- 2.2 Tree-Based Models Decision Trees **What to Know:** **Interview Questions:** Q: How do you prevent overfitting in decision trees? A: Max depth: Limit tree depth Min samples split: Require minimum samples to split Min samples leaf: Require minimum samples in leaf Pruning: Remove branches that don't improve validation Max features: Random subset of features at each split Q: Compare Gini vs Entropy. A: Gini: Faster (no log computation), tends to isolate most frequent class Entropy: Slightly more balanced splits In practice: Similar performance, Gini preferred for speed Random Forest **What to Know:** **Interview Questions:** Q: Why does Random Forest reduce variance? A: Individual trees are high variance (overfit) Bagging: Averaging reduces variance by factor of n Feature randomness: Decorrelates trees, further reducing variance Result: Var(avg) = Var(tree)/n × (1 + (n-1)ρ), where ρ is correlation Q: When would you choose Random Forest over Gradient Boosting? A: Random Forest: Faster training, parallelizable, less hyperparameter tuning Gradient Boosting: Usually higher accuracy, but slower and prone to overfit RF good for: Quick baseline, high-dimensional data, when training time matters Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) **What to Know:** **Interview Questions:** Q: Explain the difference between bagging and boosting. A: Q: How does XGBoost handle missing values? A: XGBoost learns optimal direction for missing values during training. At each split, it tries both directions for missing values and picks the one with best gain. --- 2.3 Support Vector Machines **What to Know:** **Interview Questions:** Q: What is the kernel trick and why is it useful? A: Kernel trick computes dot products in high-dimensional space without explicitly computing the transformation. This allows SVMs to find non-linear decision boundaries efficiently. Example: RBF kernel implicitly maps to infinite dimensions. Q: What is the role of C in SVM? A: Large C: Small margin, fewer misclassifications, risk of overfitting Small C: Large margin, more misclassifications, better generalization C controls bias-variance tradeoff --- 2.4 Clustering K-Means **What to Know:** **Interview Questions:** Q: What are K-means limitations? A: Assumes spherical clusters Sensitive to initialization (use K-means++) Must specify K in advance Sensitive to outliers Only finds convex clusters Q: Explain K-means++ initialization. A: Choose first centroid uniformly at random For each point, compute distance to nearest centroid Choose next centroid with probability proportional to distance² Repeat until K centroids chosen This spreads centroids apart, leading to better convergence Other Clustering Methods --- 2.5 Dimensionality Reduction PCA (Principal Component Analysis) **What to Know:** **Interview Questions:** Q: When would PCA fail? A: Non-linear relationships (use kernel PCA or t-SNE) Data not centered Features on different scales (need standardization) When variance ≠ importance Q: Explain the difference between PCA and t-SNE. A: --- 2.6 Evaluation Metrics Classification Metrics **Interview Questions:** Q: When would you optimize for precision vs recall? A: Q: Why use AUC-PR for imbalanced data? A: AUC-ROC can be misleadingly high on imbalanced data because TN dominates. AUC-PR focuses only on positive class, giving a more realistic picture. Regression Metrics **Interview Questions:** Q: When to use MAE vs MSE? A: MSE: Penalizes large errors more, sensitive to outliers MAE: More robust to outliers, harder to optimize (non-differentiable at 0) Use MAE when outliers should be treated equally Use MSE when large errors are especially bad Ranking Metrics ---"},{"kind":"section","title":"2.1 Linear Models","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"21-linear-models","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Linear Regression","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"linear-regression","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Logistic Regression","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"logistic-regression","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"2.2 Tree-Based Models","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"22-tree-based-models","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Decision Trees","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"decision-trees","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Random Forest","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"random-forest","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"gradient-boosting-xgboost-lightgbm","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"2.3 Support Vector Machines","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"23-support-vector-machines","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"2.4 Clustering","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"24-clustering","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"K-Means","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"k-means","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Other Clustering Methods","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"other-clustering-methods","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"2.5 Dimensionality Reduction","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"25-dimensionality-reduction","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"PCA (Principal Component Analysis)","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"pca-principal-component-analysis","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"2.6 Evaluation Metrics","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"26-evaluation-metrics","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Classification Metrics","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"classification-metrics","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Regression Metrics","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"regression-metrics","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"section","title":"Ranking Metrics","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Classical Machine Learning (Guide)","anchor":"ranking-metrics","category":"ML Core","pageTitle":"Classical Machine Learning (Guide)"},{"kind":"page","title":"Deep Learning (Guide)","slug":"20-ML-Core/Guide/Deep Learning (Guide)","category":"ML Core","body":"Deep Learning (Guide) Related: Plan: [[20-ML-Core/Module 02 - Deep Learning Foundations]] Concepts tracker: [[20-ML-Core/Concepts TrackerDeep Learning]] Quick reference: [[20-ML-Core/ML Cheat Sheet]] 3.1 Neural Network Fundamentals Forward Propagation Backpropagation **Interview Questions:** Q: Why do we need non-linear activations?

Dot product, norm, unit vectors Embeddings, similarity Matrices Multiplication, transpose, inverse Weight matrices in NN Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors Definition, computation, meaning PCA, understanding transformations Matrix Decomposition SVD, eigendecomposition Dimensionality reduction, recommendations Linear Independence Span, basis, rank Feature selection Key Formulas to Memorize Interview Questions **Q: What is the geometric interpretation of dot product?** A: Dot product measures how much two vectors point in the same direction. It equals a b cos(θ), where θ is the angle between them. If orthogonal, dot product = 0. **Q: Why do we use cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance for embeddings?** A: Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors, ignoring magnitude. This is important for text embeddings where document length shouldn't affect similarity - a longer document isn't necessarily more similar. **Q: Explain SVD and its applications in ML.** A: SVD decomposes matrix A = UΣVᵀ where U and V are orthogonal and Σ is diagonal with singular values. Applications: Dimensionality reduction (keep top k singular values) Matrix completion (recommendations) Noise reduction Latent semantic analysis in NLP Study Resources 3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra (YouTube playlist) Khan Academy: Linear Algebra course Book: \"Linear Algebra Done Right\" by Axler (advanced) --- 1.2 Probability & Statistics Core Concepts to Master Concept What to Know Interview Relevance --------- -------------- --------------------- Probability Basics Conditional prob, independence, Bayes Naive Bayes, probabilistic models Distributions Normal, Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson Data modeling, assumptions Expectation & Variance E[X], Var(X), properties Loss functions, bias-variance Maximum Likelihood MLE derivation, intuition Training objectives Bayesian Inference Prior, posterior, likelihood Bayesian methods Key Formulas to Memorize Interview Questions **Q: Derive the MLE for the mean of a Gaussian distribution.** A: **Q: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.** A: **Q: When would you use Bayesian vs. Frequentist approaches?** A: Bayesian: When you have prior knowledge, small data, need uncertainty estimates Frequentist: Large data, need computational efficiency, interpretable point estimates Study Resources StatQuest: Probability playlist (YouTube) Khan Academy: Statistics and Probability Book: \"All of Statistics\" by Wasserman --- 1.3 Calculus & Optimization Core Concepts to Master Concept What to Know Interview Relevance --------- -------------- --------------------- Derivatives Chain rule, partial derivatives Backpropagation Gradients Gradient vector, directional derivative Optimization Convexity Convex functions, local vs global minima Loss landscape Optimization Gradient descent variants Training neural networks Lagrange Multipliers Constrained optimization SVM derivation Key Formulas to Memorize Interview Questions **Q: Derive the gradient of the cross-entropy loss.** A: **Q: Why does Adam work better than vanilla SGD?** A: Adaptive learning rates: Different rates for each parameter Momentum: Smooths gradients, escapes local minima Bias correction: Handles early training instability Works well with sparse gradients (NLP, recommendations) **Q: What problems can occur with gradient descent?** A: Vanishing gradients: Gradients → 0, weights don't update Exploding gradients: Gradients → ∞, training unstable Saddle points: Gradient = 0 but not minimum Local minima: Stuck in suboptimal solution Oscillation: Learning rate too high ---"},{"kind":"section","title":"1.1 Linear
